# F1_History_Analysis
A dive into the history of F1, its drivers, tracks, teams, and champions

In this Jupyter notebook I briefly explore the history of F1, first by looking at the data to understand it, then focusing on drivers, teams, tracks and the intricacies of the sport. I wrap it up with a 15 point analysis of Sir Lewis Hamilton and his impact on the F1 all-time stats, highlighting why he is one of the best if not the best driver oif all time.

f1_data.csv contains the historical data used, and F1_History_Analysis.ipynb runs the scripts in a user_friendly way so that it can be visualized every step of the way.
